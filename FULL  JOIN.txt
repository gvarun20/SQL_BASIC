SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.employee_name, departments.department_name

FROM employees

FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPLANATION

A FULL JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either the "employees" or "departments" table.
 If there is no match in one of the tables, the result will still include a row, but with NULL values for columns from the table with no match.
